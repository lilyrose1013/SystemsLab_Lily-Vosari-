    <h1>Project 1 Collage</h1>
    <h2>This is the Project 1: Collage  </h2>
<h3>My Ideation behing this project was to create a pop art collage, but while doing it I had come to the conclusion ovelaping images is very hard <br>
especially with 'Grid Box' and for me grid bod is easier to understand haveing a organized grid format. <br> 
So I changed my format to use this project to better understand layering grids, and formating with both images and text. <br> 
So my theme changed to Tea, with a imformative mood board of tea. <br> With page 1 displaying the different types of teas, Page 2 Haveing corralating food parings for the teas <br>
and lastly haveing ideas of places to drink tea.  </h3>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <h3> Things I can improve on and what I learned. <br> I used this assignement to help improve my grid box understanding, especially with the concept of overlaying/overlapping items. <br>
      I really want this project to be more creative and "artsy" but was unable to do so as I was struggling to make the grid, exaclty to my liking. <br> 
      I want to keep working on this page and make it more interactive in my free time, with Pop-ups when the use over overs a image. <br> 
      I wanted to add a animation of a text with a image and link of more information with the history of the tea. <br> 
      Along with include similar animaltion for the food page; along with providing places near the user for the "place to enjoy tea" page.
